#Error handling

Errors are returned using standard HTTP error code syntax. Any additional info is included in the body of the return call, JSON-formatted. Error codes not listed here are in the REST API methods listed below.

Standard API errors

CODE |  DESCRIPTION
--- | ---
**400** | Bad input parameter. Error message should indicate which one and why.
**401** | Authorization required. The presented credentials, if any, were not sufficient to access the folder resource. Returned if an application attempts to use an access token after it has expired.
**403** | Forbidden. The requester does not have permission to access the specified resource.
**404** | File or folder not found at the specified path.
**405** | Request method not expected (generally should be GET or POST).
**5xx** | Server error


#Authentication

After successfully receiving the credentials from keystone, it is necessary that all the calls of the API will be authenticated. To authenticate the calls, it needs to add the header explained in the next table:

OAuth PARAMETER |  DESCRIPTION
--- | ---
**X-Auth-Token** | Admin token obtained after a successful authentication in keystone.

#Metrics Workload

## Add a workload metric

An application can registry a metric workload by issuing an HTTP POST request. The application needs to provide the metric workload metadata like json format.

### Request

#### URL structure

#### Method
POST

#### Request Query arguments
JSON input that contains a dictionary with the following keys:

FIELD |  DESCRIPTION
--- | ---
**name** | The name is the keyword to be used in condition clauses of storage policy definitions. Workload metric names should be unique and self-descriptive to ease the design of storage policies.
**network location** | This requires the metadata information of a workload metric to provide the network location to reach the process and obtain the computed metric.
**metric type** | Workload metricâ€™s metadata should define the type of metric produces, such a integer or a boolean, to enable the DSL syntax checker to infer if values in condition clauses belong to the appropriate type.

```
POST /registry/metrics

Response <201>
TODO
